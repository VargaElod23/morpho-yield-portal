## Development Notes

### Notification System Architecture

The push notification system uses:
- **Service Worker** (`/public/sw.js`) for background processing
- **Web Push API** with VAPID authentication
- **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage (with in-memory fallback)
- **Cron Jobs** for daily notification delivery
- **Batch Processing** to handle rate limits (5 users per batch)

### Calculation Consistency

All yield calculations now use the same transaction-based approach:

```typescript
// Standard calculation used across all components
const totalBalance = userVaults.reduce((sum, v) => sum + (v.yieldData?.currentBalance || 0), 0);
const totalDeposited = transactions
  .filter(tx => tx.type === 'MetaMorphoDeposit')
  .reduce((sum, tx) => sum + tx.data.assetsUsd, 0);
const totalYield = totalBalance - totalDeposited;
```

### Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge: Full support including notifications
- ‚úÖ Firefox: Full support including notifications  
- ‚úÖ Safari: Full support including notifications
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Brave: Notifications blocked by default (warning shown)
- ‚úÖ Mobile PWA: Full notification support when installed

### Performance Optimizations

- Memoized providers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Batched API calls to reduce server load
- Efficient caching strategies with React Query
- Optimized bundle size with tree shaking
